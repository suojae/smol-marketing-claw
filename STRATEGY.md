- Visual design that feels welcoming

**Why it matters:**
- Reduces intimidation factor for beginners
- Creates emotional connection with users
- Makes learning fun instead of overwhelming
- Memorable and shareable

### 2. "5-Minute Start" Experience

**Goal**: From zero to running autonomous AI in 5 minutes

**How:**
```bash
# Just three commands
git clone https://github.com/suojae/smol-claw.git
cd smol-claw
./quickstart.sh
```

**Features:**
- Auto-install dependencies
- Interactive setup wizard
- Pre-configured defaults that work
- Instant gratification

**Competitor comparison:**
- OpenClaw: ~30 minutes setup
- Nanobot: ~15 minutes setup
- Smol Claw: ~5 minutes setup

### 3. "Learning by Doing" Philosophy

**Target**: Students, coding bootcamp grads, curious developers

**Approach:**
- Heavily commented code (every function explained)
- Step-by-step tutorials in README
- Video walkthroughs (YouTube series)

**Why focus on developers:**
- Underserved niche (most agents are generalist)
- We understand developer workflows intimately
- Natural word-of-mouth marketing (devs share tools)
- Clear use cases and pain points

### 5. "Community-First Growth"

**Strategy**: Build a warm, inclusive community

**Tactics:**
- Monthly "Crayfish Contributors" spotlight 🦞
